# Message Channel Manager Lightning Component

This is a package which can be used with Salesforce Partner Community in order to enable partners to easily reach out to their channel managers. Additionally, this also helps address a gap in the Summer '17 release where direct message components are not available in the partner central template. This package consists of two components one for the partner community and one for LEX (to allow Channel Managers to reach out to partners).

Some of the features of this package are

 * Fixed component which is always present in the bottom right hand corner of the screen
 * Ability to attach files
 * Corresponding component for LEX to allow Channel Managers to reach out Partners
 * Full screen mobile experience
 * Web Notifications for Partners
 * Ability to cache messages in local storage

A demo of the component can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/gg0TJGIELwo)

The component can be installed via a [managed package](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t0Y000001eBxY)
